# v6-glm-py

Federated Generalized Linear Model (GLM) implementation that can be run with the
[vantage6 infrastructure](https://vantage6.ai). This is a Python implementation
of the federated GLM algorithm described by
[Cellamare et al](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/15/7/243).
It is documented [here](https://algorithms.vantage6.ai/en/latest/v6-glm-py/docs/index.html).

This algorithm is also part of the vantage6
[community store](https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/algorithm_store/introduction.html#community-store)!
If you link the community store to your vantage6 server, you can easily run this algorithm
via the UI. Otherwise, you may also use the included algorithm_store.json file to upload
it to your own algorithm store.

The base code for this algorithm has been created via the
[v6-algorithm-template](https://github.com/vantage6/v6-algorithm-template)
template generator.
